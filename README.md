# TCPFileTransfer
A command-line file transfer program in Java that utilizes TCP socket programming. A "server" may handle multiple file requests by multiple "clients" in this program.

## Usage

To use this  program, first run Server.java from a Unix command line. Follow the prompts to enter a port number. Then, in a separate terminal, run Client.java. Follow the prompts to enter an IP address and the port number (if on the same machine as the Server, use 127.0.0.1 as an IP address). You can optionally run multiple clients to connect to the server. You can enter different file names in the client terminal to transfer from server to client using TCP sockets.
